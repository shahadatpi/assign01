                The philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche once said, "The doer alone learneth."
                However, the World War II General and President of the United States, Dwight D. Eisenhower, once said,
                "Plans are useless, but planning is indispensable."</p>

                <p>For learning I often highlighted books with markers. The colors were supposed to tell me different

                One of the hardest questions in life to answer is “What do you want to do?” Especially when you have
                no idea what you want to do or you are going through a transition. I can’t tell you how many times I
                flubbed through that question. It’s also tough to respond to that question even when you really do
                know what you want to do with your life but aren’t doing it yet because you don’t know how to make it
                happen.

                One of the absolute best ways to learn something is to teach it.
                Most high growth or new subjects have exponentially more beginners than experienced practitioners.
                One of the best times to teach something to those who are beginners themselves is immediately after
                you've figured it out for the first time.
